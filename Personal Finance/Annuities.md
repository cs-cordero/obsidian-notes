Annuities are a type of [[Financial Securities|investment]] with an insurance wrapper.

Because of their high costs, surrender fees, and decreased tax benefits, **annuities don't have much to offer most investors**.
- If you're in a low tax bracket as some aging investors are, there is no need for a high-priced tax-deferred annuity product.
- If for some reason you still think annuities are something you want, just make sure you put them in a low-cost annuity with no sales charges and no surrender fees, like the ones at Vanguard.

## Fixed Annuity

Similar to a bank [[Certificate of Deposit|CD]], but it's an insurance product that agrees to pay you a specific minimum rate of return for a specified period of time (usually 1 to 5 years) on the money you originally invest in the contract.

After the specified period, the rate of return reverts back to market rates.

Some fixed annuities come with a _teaser_ rate that are set to pay higher than a CD, but often come with "gotcha" lower subsequent rates and high surrender fees.
- A _surrender fee_ is similar to an early withdrawal penalty on a bank CD.
- Surrender fees can be very costly, with some set at more than 10% of the withdrawal and may last up to 10 years or even longer depending on the insurance company issuing the annuity.  The fees are reduced by 1 percent for each year you own the annuity until they disappear.
- Surrender fees make it financially impractical for you to withdraw your money, even if you find that the new interest rates the insurance company offers are not competitive with what you could receive elsewhere.

Fixed annuities money is mingled with the insurance company's operating funds.  If the insurance company has financial problems, you have problems too.

Fixed annuities offer tax deferral features, even when purchased with after-tax funds.

## Variable Annuity

An insurance contract that allows you to invest in sub-accounts, which are clones of mutual funds with some insurance coverage thrown in.

Most variable annuities have surrender fees, so you can't get all your money back without paying the surrender fee in effect at the time of the withdrawal.

Fund expenses tend to be much higher than their nonannuity mutual fund counterparts.

Offerings from one insurance company might differ in the sub-accounts to choose from.

Variable annuities offer tax deferral features, even when purchased with after-tax funds.

**There is typically no benefit to investing in an annuity inside an already tax-deferred retirement plan such as a 401K, 403B, or IRA.**

## Immediate Annuity

A contract between you and an insurance company. In exchange for a sum of money, the insurance company will promise to pay you a specific amount of money on a regular basis, for the remainder of your lifetime.
- For smaller payments, the insurance company will guarantee those payments to both you and your spouse's lives or for a specified period of time.


Similar to fixed annuities, these annuities are backed by the strength of the insurance company.
