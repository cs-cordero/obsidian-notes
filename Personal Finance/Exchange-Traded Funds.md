Also known as ETFs, are basically mutual funds that trade like stocks on an exchange.

One of the biggest benefits of owning ETFs is the low cost.  They can be as low or even lower than many mutual funds tracking the same index.

ETFs differ from [[Mutual Funds]] in how they are priced.  Mutual funds are priced at their [[Net Asset Value|NAV]], whereas ETFs are priced by an open market system just like stocks are.
- Day traders who want to know the exact price of their trade like this.

ETFs require a broker every time you buy and sell, so that typically means paying commissions.

ETFs may trade at a slight premium or discount to the value of the underlying securities held in the fund. This can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on which side of the equation your trade lies in.

ETFs are usually best for investors who can make large, one-time purchases with the intention of holding them for a long period of time.
- The commission is thereby offset by the reduced expenses incurred over a long period of time.
