[[Asset Allocation]]
- Keep international funds allocations to a maximum of 20%-40%.
- REITs should not exceed 10% of your equity portion of your portfolio.
- Sector funds should not exceed 10% of the equity portion of your portfolio.

- Avoid junk/high-yield bonds. They muddy the safety that a bond is supposed to give you in a portfolio. They are tax inefficient and even if you place them in a tax sheltered account, they crowd out other tax-inefficient funds. If you want a return it's more efficient to allocate towards stocks.
