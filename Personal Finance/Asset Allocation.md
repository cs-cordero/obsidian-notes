**This is the most important portfolio decision you will make**.


1. What are your goals?
2. What is your time frame?
3. What is your risk tolerance?
4. What is your personal finance situation?


### What are your goals?

It's important to have specific goals so that you know what you are saving for and approximately how much money is necessary.


### What is your time frame?

Stocks and funds allocated on stocks are unsuitable for short time frames.  But they can be good for long-term goals.

As a result, time frame should inform how your asset allocation looks like.


### What is your risk tolerance?

Risk-averse savers put billions of dollars in CDs and bank savings accounts, despite low yields.

Risk-tolerant savers may invest hundreds of millions of dollars in speculative investments.

You have to be brutally honest with yourself: would you sell in a brutal bear market where everyone you're talking to is urging you to sell to cut your losses?
- If you think you would sell out of fear, your portfolio is unsuitable for you.
- If you think you would hold, honestly, then your portfolio is probably suitable for your risk tolerance.


### What is your personal finance situation?

Your personal situation has a direct influence on the type and amount of securities you select.

A person with significant net worth or a large portfolio does not need to invest in risky investment in search of higher returns.

## Choosing your Investment Buckets

The [[Bogleheads Approach]] considers only three classes of [[Financial Securities|investments]] to consider as your asset allocation: [[Stocks]], [[Bonds]], and Cash.
- Other exotic investment types that Bogleheads advise against: limited partnerships, hedge funds, timber, gold, penny stocks, unit trusts, options, commodity futures, etc.

The Bogleheads approach advises three guidelines for allocating between stocks, bonds, and cash:
1. Jack Bogle suggests that the percent of bonds in your portfolio should equal your age.
2. Use the table below to show how a declining amount of stocks relative to bonds contribute to expected returns.
3. Vanguard has an online questionnaire and suggested asset allocation.

## Stock Allocation Subdivisions

Stocks can be divided into Large-, Mid-, and Small-Cap depending on the size of the company backing them.  In addition they can be divided into three styles: Value, Core and Growth.

Value, Core, and Growth are roughly the price of the stock relative to what analysts think the stock is worth.  Value represents that the stock is under-priced, meaning you get to buy it at a discount.  Core means that the stock is relatively priced according to its value.  Growth means that the stock is more expensive according to its present value.  Growth stocks are still invested in because there is some belief/hope that the company itself will grow more valuable over time.  The fact that investors are overpaying into it indicates that at least some segment of the market believe the stock will do well.

## Bond Allocation Subdivisions

A single, low-cost, short- or intermediate-term, good quality, bond fund should be adequate for small investors.  The bond fund should have a [[Bonds#^bfc63c|duration]] equal to or less than the expected time frame needed to meet your goals. ^289550

A broad-based, diversified bond fund such as Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund is a good option.

If you have a short time frame or worried about volatility should opt for a short-term bond fund.
