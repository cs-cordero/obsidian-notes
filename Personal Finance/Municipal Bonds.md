Municipal [[Bonds]] are sold by state and local governments to pay for government-approved projects.

They are normally free from federal taxes, and normally free from state and local taxes (of the state issuing the bond and the city issuing the bond respectively).

Municipal bonds typically pay less than comparable taxable bonds, but can make sense for investors in the higher tax brackets (usually 25 percent and above).

Some municipal bond issues are subject to the IRS Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT).  If you're subject to the AMT, check carefully if the bonds you want to buy are subject to this tax.

Some municipal bond issues carry insurance that promises to cover the interest and principal payments should the bond issuer have problems.  This insurance **is only as good as the financial strength of the insurer**.

Some municipal bond issues come backed by the full taxing authority of the issuer, while others are guaranteed only by the revenue generated by the particular project that the bonds were issued to finance.
