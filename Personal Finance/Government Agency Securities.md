Despite the name, Government Agency Securities are considered a type of [[Bond]] (they have a maturity and an interest rate).

The government agencies we're taking about here are:
1. Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, or Ginnie Mae)
2. Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie Mae)
3. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).

Ginnie, Fannie, and Freddie issues pools of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that investors may purchase, either directly or via bond mutual funds.

A GNMA-backed security represents a financial interest in a repackaged group of individual mortgages.  The underlying mortgages are insured by other federal agencies, such as the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
- When interest rates rise, the value of the GNMA bond and GNMA bond funds holding the bond drops.  The value drops because mortgage holders are disincentivized to prepay their existing mortgages, which means the GNMA bonds are holding lots of mortgages at the lower interest rates.
- When interest rates drop, the value of the GNMA bond is typically cut short.  Homeowners tend to refinance their mortgages, thus paying off the investors in the underlying GNMA securities. Then investors will have to put their prepaid money back to work sooner than expected, and at a lower yield (since the interest rates have dropped).

Fannie and Freddie, conversely, still repackage and sell pools of existing mortgages to investors as securities.  These securities are not, in fact, guaranteed by the "full faith and credit of the United States" the same way that GNMA-backed securities are.
- They are instead guaranteed by government departments such as the VA or FHA.
