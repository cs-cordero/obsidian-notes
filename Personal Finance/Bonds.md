Bonds are a type of [[Financial Securities|investment]], not unlike an IOU.

When purchasing bonds at an **initial issue**, you are lending a specific amount of money to the bond issuer.  In return, you're promised a return on investment that is the bond's yield to maturity and the return of the face value of the bond at a _maturity date_.

Bond maturities may be short-term (1-year or less), intermediate-term (2 to 10 years), and long term (10 or more years).  Bonds may be issued by a number of entities, e.g., the US Treasury, Government Agencies, Corporations, Municipalities.

## Maturity and Duration

^bfc63c

All bonds have a maturity date, which is the date that investors are repaid the principal amount of the bond.
- This differs from [[Bond Funds]], which are constantly buying new bonds to replace bonds that are maturing.

_Duration_ is measures how long it takes, in years, for an investor to be repaid a bond’s price by the bond’s total cash flows.

Duration can also measure the sensitivity of a bond’s or fixed income portfolio’s price to changes in interest rates.
- A measure to help bond fund investors determine if a particular bond fund might be appropriate for them.
- Stated in whole and partial years, e.g., 4.3 years.
- The higher the duration, the more volatile the bond or bond fund would be in a changing interest rate environment.
- When interest rates increase, the value of bonds and bond funds decrease. When interest rates fall, the value of bonds and bond funds increases.
