Net Asset Value (NAV) is the net value of an investment fund's assets less its liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding.

The NAV is most commonly used in the context of a [[Mutual Funds|Mutual Fund]] or an [[Exchange-Traded Funds|Exchange-Traded Fund]].

NAV is the price at which the shares of the funds registered with the SEC are traded.
