Treasury Issues are a generally considered a type of [[Bonds|Bond]] investment and the safest since they're backed by the full faith and credit of the US government.

## T-Bills, T-Notes, T-Bonds. Also known as _Treasuries_.
- Treasury Bills (T-Bills) are currently issued for 13-, 26-, and 52-week periods.
- Treasury Notes (T-Notes) are currently issued for 2, 3, 5, and 10 years.
- Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds) are issued for periods greater than 10 years.
- Free from state and local taxes.

## Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)
- Created in 1997.
- Offers protection against inflation.
- Free from state and local taxes.
- Unlike I Bonds, where the Treasury sets the fixed rate, the guaranteed rate on TIPS is established by the marketplace at the Treasury's TIPS auctions.
- Can be purchased via TreasuryDirect, on the secondary market, or via a TIPS fund like Vanguard's VIPSX or Fidelity's FINPX.
- TIPS-guaranteed rates are usually higher than I Bond fixed rates. **Therefore, if you have to choose between the two in a tax-deferred account, it should go to TIPS investments as they offer inflation protection without risking principal**.
- TIPS come with a major downside: _phantom income_, which you have to pay taxes on even though you won't receive that income until maturity.

## US Savings Bonds (I Bonds and EE Bonds)
- Both types have a minimum 1-year holding period.  After this holding period, they can be cashed in at any time before 30 years with no loss of principal.
	- Cashing them in prior to 5 years loses the last three month's interest.
- Interest rates on these bonds are announced each May and November by the Treasury.
- Both EE and I Bonds are tax-deferred for up to 30 years. So they're a good option as an asset in a taxable account if you don't need current income from your bond holdings.

### I Bonds

I Bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, which effectively means that the are risk-free.

I Bonds have two parts:
1. They have a fixed _real rate_ as stated at the time you purchase the I Bond. This rate remains the same for the life of the bond, typically 30 years.
2. They have a variable inflation-adjustment rate that is recalculated and announced twice annually. The variable rate is based on the rate of inflation.

The only drawback to I Bonds is that you are taxed on the _entire_ return of the bond: the inflation part and fixed real rate part.
- As a result, cashing the I Bond when you're in a high tax bracket could possibly end up with less spending power than you started with.

### EE Bonds

EE Bonds purchased after May 1, 2005 have a fixed rate, similar to a [[Certificate of Deposit|CD]].  But EE Bonds come with a guarantee from the Treasury that the bond will double in value in 20 years, even if the Treasury has to add money at 20 years to make it happen.
- Can be used tax free for all qualifying educational expenses for you, your spouse and your children.
- Free from state and local taxes.
