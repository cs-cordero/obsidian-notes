The Rule of 72 states:

> To determine how many years it will take an investment to double in value, divide 72 by the annual rate of return.  For example, an investment that returns 8 percent doubles every 9 years (72/8 = 9).  Similarly, an investment that returns 9 percent doubles every 8 years.  One that returns 12 percent doubles every 6 years.

In general, this rule is used to quickly understand the effect of [[Compounding]] on your investments: specifically that there is great value in starting _early_.  Early means you get to reap the benefit from these doublings.
