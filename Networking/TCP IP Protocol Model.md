## Context

The TCP/IP Protocol Model was developed in 1989 by DARPA and specified in RFC 1122.

Protocols in each layer are clearly defined, unlike in the OSI model.

The TCP/IP protocol have **real**, practical implications, because people didn't design the model at the outset.  They just built the Internet, then reverse-engineered a reference model for theoretical and pedagogical purposes.  The OSI model is mainly conceptual and theoretical for teaching purposes, but implementations don't generally follow it.

## The Layers

In the TCP/IP Protocol Model, there are five layers. At first glance it's just the OSI model with the Presentation and Session layers removed:

1. [[Application Layer|Application]]
2. Transport
3. Network
4. Data Link
5. Physical
